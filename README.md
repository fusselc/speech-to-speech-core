# speech-to-speech-core

Phase 1 speech-to-speech AI core in Python: microphone recording, Whisper transcription, and text-to-speech playback for a modular low-latency voice pipeline.

---

## Overview

This repository implements a single speech-to-speech turn:

```text
Microphone → WAV file → Whisper → transcript → responder → TTS → speaker
```

Each stage lives in its own module so components can be swapped or extended later—for example, streaming transcription, LLM-backed responses, or higher-quality speech synthesis—without changing the rest of the pipeline.

---

## Design Goals

* Keep each stage isolated in its own module
* Keep functions small and readable
* Centralize configuration in `src/config.py`
* Make the pipeline runnable first, then extensible
* Measure latency so performance is visible and improvable

---

## Module Responsibilities

* `audio_input.py` — microphone capture and WAV persistence
* `transcribe.py` — Whisper speech-to-text
* `responder.py` — simple text response generation
* `synthesize.py` — local text-to-speech playback
* `latency_logger.py` — per-stage and total latency timing
* `utils.py` — shared helpers
* `app.py` — orchestration of the full speech-to-speech turn

## Requirements

* Python 3.10 or newer
* A working microphone
* On Linux, `espeak` must be installed for `pyttsx3`

```bash
sudo apt-get install espeak
```

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fusselc/speech-to-speech-core.git
cd speech-to-speech-core

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** `openai-whisper` downloads model weights on first run (~150 MB for the default `base` model). Internet is only required for that initial download.

---

## Run

```bash
python src/app.py
```

When the program starts:

1. Audio is recorded from microphone
2. WAV file is saved
3. Whisper transcribes speech
4. A response is generated
5. TTS speaks the response
6. Latency is printed

By default the pipeline runs in loop mode.

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop.

To disable looping:

Edit `src/config.py`

```python
LOOP_MODE = False
```

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `src/config.py`.

| Setting            | Default  | Description                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `RECORD_DURATION`  | `5.0`    | Recording duration in seconds |
| `WHISPER_MODEL`    | `"base"` | Whisper model size            |
| `WHISPER_LANGUAGE` | `None`   | Auto-detect language          |
| `TTS_RATE`         | `180`    | Speech speed                  |
| `LOOP_MODE`        | `True`   | Repeat turns                  |
| `MAX_TURNS`        | `0`      | Unlimited turns               |

## Expected Output Example

```text
==================================================
Speech-to-Speech Core | Phase 1
==================================================
[audio_input] Recording for 5.0 second(s)… speak now.
[audio_input] Saved recording to: recordings/turn_0001.wav
[transcribe] Transcript: What time is it?
[responder] Response: I heard: What time is it?
[synthesize] Speaking: I heard: What time is it?
[latency] summary:
[latency] recording_ms=5000.00
[latency] save_ms=3.12
[latency] transcription_ms=850.00
[latency] response_ms=2.00
[latency] synthesis_ms=120.00
[latency] total_ms=5975.12
==================================================
Done.
==================================================
```

---

## Latency Metrics

Latency is tracked per stage:

* `recording_ms`
* `save_ms`
* `transcription_ms`
* `response_ms`
* `synthesis_ms`
* `total_ms`

This makes optimization measurable.

---

## Tests

Run tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

If needed install pytest:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Tests are written to remain CI-friendly and avoid hardware dependency through mocking.

---

## OpenVoice Integration (Future)

`src/synthesize.py` already contains the correct integration point for replacing current TTS with OpenVoice later.

---

## Extending the Pipeline

| Goal                 | File             |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Stream audio         | `audio_input.py` |
| Faster transcription | `transcribe.py`  |
| LLM responses        | `responder.py`   |
| Better TTS           | `synthesize.py`  |
| Config changes       | `config.py`      |

---

## Troubleshooting

* Verify microphone permissions if recording fails
* Install `espeak` if Linux TTS fails
* Whisper first run requires model download
* Use smaller Whisper models if slow

---

## Roadmap

Planned next steps:

* Faster transcription backend
* Streaming audio input
* Advanced response generation
* Higher quality speech synthesis
* Interrupt handling
* OpenVoice integration
